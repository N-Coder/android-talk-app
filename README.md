wrote this piece of software. It was written as an demonstration app for a
talk about Android development on Thursday, 30th of April, 2015. The talk
was given for students of the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics,
University of Passau and organized by the IEEE Student Branch Passau.
As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this
stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can
buy us a beer in return. "A beer" can be replaced by a pizza, piece of
chocolate or any other goodie.
Cheers,
Niko Fink & Marco Ziegaus
